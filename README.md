Nothing is better than plain text. Nothing. Not even Markdown or HTML. If the world would just agree to standardize on plain text, so many good things will happen!

First, the Internet would get faster, cheaper, and better. Most of the performance, cost, and quality problems that plague our online life are caused by mixing content with style and function. (The rest are caused by caching.) If content, in this case text content, was 100% separated from style and function we would live in a world were web pages loaded instantly, cost less to host, and work reliably.

This claim is not idle speculation on my part! It's proven by decades of source code control. Imagine how terrible the software development world would be if code was not stored in a plain text format! Code would become specific to particular editors, operating systems, and applications--just like web pages and mobile apps are today. 

Open up a source code file in any text editor from almost any era and the content will display, readable and well formatted. We simply can't do that with the web pages and mobile app views of yesterday, today, and if we don't act, tomorrow. Heck, if we were to stick with plain text we could chisel our content into stone tablets and ensure that our dependents, thousands of years from now, would be able to read our blog posts.

I'm not saying we need to live in a vanilla world of monospaced characters and two-color screens. We can always add formatting and functionality separately from the text. This is what Markdown and HTML were supposed to do. Our phones and laptops are powerful enough to use algorithms to smartly apply style as needed. This is what modern IDEs, like Xcode and Android Studio, do when they make source code more readable and navigable.

I'm not a text-only nut. I like images and video as well. But it's all media formats have same problem with the mixing of style, function, and content. If your video stream is encoded with hints for keyframes and ad breaks, your video eventually will no longer play.

And with all this important trivia in plain text it will work well for our voice assistants. Instead of getting a list of webpages we'll reliably get the answer.

This project, plain-text cheat sheets, is born out of my frustration in remembering all the mind numbing detail one needs to remember when creating apps and websites. When I need to remember the resolution of the iPhone 6s, I don't want to wait for your website to render!

There is no format and no rules, other than plain text. And of course plain text isn't a single universal format. My text files are in macOS standard POSIX format with the UTI "public.plain-text"

I'm thinking of writing some code to parse these files and apply style and functionality. But honestly, most browsers, text editors, word processor and operating systems already handle text well. Better than they handle their native formats.
